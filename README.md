# weather_app
a simple weather app to practice API usage and constructing GUIs

for now, the program displays the weather results in the terminal, I am working on making a GUI to make the program much more intuitive.

Additionally, I will thank free code camp and NeuralNine for the wonderful help on YouTube.
